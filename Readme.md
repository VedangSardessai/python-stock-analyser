# Python Stock Analyzer
Hey there!
I am building this project to use python to analyze stock market data.

I am using [ta-lib](https://www.ta-lib.org/) as the main library for the technical analysis, check out the library.  

* If you plan on using the library you will first need to download whl file that meets your system requirements from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib).


* After Downloading the file copy it to the working directory of your project.


* Use the `pip install downloadedfile.ext` the filename will be similar to .\TA_Lib-0.4.24-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl.

* Finally, do a `pip install TA-Lib` and you will be good to go.
